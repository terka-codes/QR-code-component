## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced my knowledge of the CSS Flexbox element. I found it hard to center the element vertically at the beginning but then I revised my knowledge about Flexbox properties and it all clicked and I realized what exactly I should do.

Note: Always remember to put the height, otherwise the flexbox won't align vertically.

To remember in the future & for you to see what I am talking about:

```css
#main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-content: center;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I think I am getting along with HTML quite well, but I sometimes still struggle with Flexbox. In the upcoming days and weeks, I want to focus on practicing flexbox and grid and learning more CSS animations and other fun features. Then I can peacefully proceed to the Java script. But of course, learn HTML and CSS still, because I know I can't even know everything. 👩‍💻
